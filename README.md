# WeatherPy

Hi Grader. This project is incomplete. But I can only have a 2 missing assignments so I've put all the work I was able to get done into this rep. 

Here is how far I got to help you grade =D. 

**Self Grade : 47/100**

**Self Grade Explanation: I gave my self full credit for all sections that I finished. and no grade for anything I didn't do. I did subtract 3 cause I didn't have weather description.** 

Deliverable 1
* Retrieve all of the following information from the API call: (15 pt)
   * Latitude and longitude **DONE**
   * Maximum temperature **DONE**
   * Percent humidity **DONE**
   * Percent cloudiness **DONE**
   * Wind speed **DONE**
   * Weather description (for example, clouds, fog, light rain, clear sky) **WAS NOT DONE**
* Add the weather data to a new DataFrame (5 pt) **DONE**
* Export the DataFrame as WeatherPy_Database.csv into the Weather_Database folder (5 pt) **DONE**

Deliverable 2 
Note if you notice that some of the code is errored on the file its cause i tried to reattempt it and didn't want to re run through every city again sense I already had a csv. file containing the hotels. 

* Input statements are written to prompt the customer for their minimum and maximum temperature preferences. (5 pt) **DONE**
* A new DataFrame is created based on the minimum and maximum temperature, and empty rows are dropped. (5 pt) **DONE**
* The hotel name is retrieved and added to the DataFrame, and the rows that donâ€™t have a hotel name are dropped. (10 pt) **DONE**
* The DataFrame is exported as a CSV file into the Vacation_Search folder and is saved as WeatherPy_vacation.csv. (5 pt) **DONE**
* A marker layer map with pop-up markers for the cities in the vacation DataFrame is created, and it is uploaded as a PNG. Each marker has the following information: (5 pt) **WAS NOT DONE**
   * Hotel name **WAS NOT DONE**
   * City **WAS NOT DONE**
   * Country **WAS NOT DONE**
   * Current weather description with the maximum temperature **WAS NOT DONE**
